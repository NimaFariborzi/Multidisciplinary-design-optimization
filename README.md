# MAE 290b Final Project
Numerical Methods for Differential Equations Final Project Using ADI

Final Project Code for MAE290B (UCSD Winter 2023)

Code written as part of the final project for MAE 290B: Numerical Methods for Differential Equations. The Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method was implemented to solve an unsteady, nonhomogeneous reaction-diffusion equation with zero Dirichlet boundary condition on a 2D rectangular domain. The source strength and initial condition are provided.
