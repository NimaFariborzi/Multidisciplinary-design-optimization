# Multidisciplinary-design-optimization
Multidisciplinary design optimization project for MAE 207 

Final Project Code for MAE207 (UCSD Winter 2023)

Code written as part of the final project for MAE 207: Multidisciplinary-design-optimization. The Quasi-Newton method BFGS was used to solve for the most optimum angles for the ramps of a external compression inlet for an airbreathing supersonic vehicle.
